## Write a program to accept two integers and find their sum.
X,Y = int(input("Enter First No:")), int(input("Enter Second No:"))

Z = X + Y

print("Addition of",X,"and",Y,"is",Z)

print("Addition of %d and %d is %d"%(X,Y,Z))

print("Addition of {} and {} id {}".format(X,Y,Z))

print(f"Addition of {X} and {Y} is {Z}")
      

      
## Same addition can be written in a single line code as below.

print("Answer=", int(input("Enter First No:"))+int(input("Enter second No:")))
